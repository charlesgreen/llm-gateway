/**
 * THE PUBLISH GATE, WATCHED FIRING (DESIGN.md §4.2 step 4; AGENTS.md "Gate").
 *
 * The tag-truthfulness check guards an IRREVERSIBLE step, and the only way to exercise
 * it end to end in CI would be to cut a real tag and publish a real immutable version —
 * which is exactly what it exists to prevent. So it is verified here instead, as a pure
 * function over the raw ref, with a negative control on every failure mode it claims to
 * catch. A gate nobody has watched fire is a false clear.
 *
 * The interesting cases are all ref-shaped, not version-shaped: `github.ref` vs
 * `github.ref_name` differ only by the `refs/tags/` prefix and are trivially swapped in
 * YAML, so "was handed a bare tag name" and "was handed a branch ref" are the realistic
 * bugs — not a typo'd semver.
