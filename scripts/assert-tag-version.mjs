/**
 * ASSERT-TAG-VERSION — the publish gate's tag-truthfulness check (DESIGN.md §4.2, step 4).
 *
 * A published version is IMMUTABLE. `v0.2.0` cut from a tree whose package.json still
 * says `0.1.0` publishes `0.1.0` under a tag that claims otherwise — and the mismatch is
 * then discovered by a consumer, months later, as "the version I pinned isn't the code I
 * read". Unpublishing is disruptive at best and blocked at worst, so this is checked
 * BEFORE the irreversible step, not after.
 *
 * The check takes the RAW ref (`refs/tags/v0.1.0`), not a pre-stripped tag name, because
 * ref parsing is where this actually goes wrong: `github.ref` and `github.ref_name` differ
 * by that prefix and are trivially swapped in YAML. Requiring the full ref means a
 * workflow wired to a branch push — or to a non-tag ref of any kind — fails loudly here
 * instead of publishing off whatever happened to be checked out.
 *
 * Deliberately strict, in all three directions:
 *   - the ref MUST be `refs/tags/…`             (not a branch, not a bare tag name)
 *   - the tag MUST carry the leading `v`        (`0.1.0` is not this repo's tag shape)
 *   - the remainder MUST equal the version EXACTLY (no coercion, no semver-range logic —
 *     `v0.1.0` and `v0.01.0` are different tags and only one of them is the version)
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/assert-tag-version.mjs [ref]     (defaults to $GITHUB_REF)
 * Exits 0 on a match, 1 on anything else. `assertTagVersion` is imported by the vitest
 * gate, which proves each failure mode fires.
